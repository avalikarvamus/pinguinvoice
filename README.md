# pinguinvoice
Small Flask/SQLAlchemy invoice maker for small company.

Currently under implementation. So mostly a learming project.

SQLite3 DB in file.

I used pypy 2.6 version as Python interpreter for some time. For this requirements includes psycopg2cffi. For cpyhton psycopg2 should work too and recently has been made default again.

In app/static/js should have:

angular.js
bootstrap.min.js
jquery-3.1.0.js

And app/static/css:

bootstrap.min.css

For Angular frontend /angular/ usage.
It's not workable yet.
